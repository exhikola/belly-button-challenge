# belly-button-challenge


In this project, I developed an interactive dashboard to explore the Belly Button Biodiversity dataset, which contains information about the microbial species present in human navels in JSON format.

The dataset highlights that a small number of microbial species, referred to as operational taxonomic units (OTUs), were found in over 70% of individuals, while the remaining species were relatively uncommon.

The dashboard includes dynamically populated demographic information based on the user-selected test subject ID. Upon changing the ID, various visualizations such as a bar chart, bubble chart, and a bonus gauge chart are updated accordingly. The implementation utilizes technologies such as Plotly, JavaScript, HTML, CSS, and D3.js.

All necessary CSS, JS, and images are organized under the static folder, and the primary HTML file, index.html, is located in the root folder of the GitHub repository. This ensures a structured and organized approach to presenting the interactive dashboard for exploring the fascinating Belly Button Biodiversity dataset.
